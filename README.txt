ECG EMG processing
==================

 Semestral project: ECG and EMG analysis utilizing signal processing techniques.

Assignment
==========

 1) R peak detection - find R peak in the ECG signal from physionet drivedb.
 2) ECG correlation - calculate the correlation between different drivedb measurements and compare them.
 3) EMG classification - rectify and integrate the EMG signal and detect changes based on derivation (increase or decrease).


Notes
=====

 Use WFDB function wfdb.rdsamp to load the physionet records.
